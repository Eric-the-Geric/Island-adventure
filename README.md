# Island-adventure

This was a very simple platformer I made for a game jam. It was made in 48 hours and was the second game I ever created. The graphics are terrible (also the second time every trying to make assets).
Out of 12 participants, I came 4th for game-play which I am proud of. See https://alakajam.com/16th-alakajam/1351/island-ascension/ for the reviews as well.
